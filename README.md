# Game of Life
### An implementation of John Conway’s famous cellular automaton The Game of Life, built in Unity. This program takes advantage of compute shaders to allow the user to play The Game of Life using a modern screen resolution (ex: 1920x1080) while still maintaining a high number of Frames per Second (FPS), 30+. Attempting to run The Game of Life at a modern resolution without compute shaders results in a low FPS since every pixel, referred to as a 'Cell', is updated every frame.

## Compute Shaders
### Compute shaders are a helpful tool for running simulations in Unity that require a large number of calculations per frame. These shader programs divide the computations in each frame into groups and then pass those them onto the GPU to be computed in parrallel.
